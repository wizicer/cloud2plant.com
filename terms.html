					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Surreal CMS (“Service”) is provided by
						<a href="http://www.abeautifulsite.net/">A Beautiful Site,
						LLC</a> (“Company”). By using any portion of the service,
						which includes any and all services provided for content
						management purposes, you are accepting the Terms of
						Service (“terms”) provided herein. If you do not agree
						with these terms for any reason, you are asked not to
						use Surreal CMS. Use of the Service indicates your
						acceptance of these terms. A Beautiful Site, LLC.
						reserves the right to update or modify these terms at
						any time without notice. For the most recent, official
						terms of service, refer back to this page at any time.
					</p>
					<h2>Usage</h2>
					<p>
						As an account holder, A Beautiful Site, LLC. grants you
						a limited license to access and use Surreal CMS. The
						Company reserves the right to terminate this license at
						any time for any reason. This right will generally be
						practiced only when abuse of the service or nonpayment
						has been determined.
					</p>

					<h2>Billing &amp; Refund Policy</h2>
					<p>
						A Beautiful Site, LLC. charges and collects for use of
						Surreal CMS. The payment amount is determined by your
						subscription level. Payment amounts are calculated from
						the <a href="pricing.html">schedule of fees</a> or ‘as quoted’.
						The Company reserves the right to modify the schedule of
						fees and charges at any time, and any such change will
						come into effect immediately for new subscribers and upon
						the subscription renewal for existing subscribers.
					</p>
					<p>
						While the subscription is not delinquent and this agreement
						remains in force, your subscription will be automatically
						renewed upon the completion of the subscription period,
						and where you are responsible for payment, you will be
						invoiced in accordance with the schedule of fees in force
						at that time, excepting the case where your service is
						subject to a quotation or a written pricing agreement
						signed by a Managing Member of A Beautiful Site, LLC.
						Any such negotiated pricing terms are confidential and
						may not be disclosed to a third party.
					</p>
					<p>
						Subscriptions may be canceled at any time without
						incurring a cancellation fee. Changes in your
						subscription may not take effect until your
						subscription renewal period. Premature cancellation of
						your subscription does not make you eligible for a
						refund in whole or part. If you believe your invoice
						is incorrect for any reason, you must contact
						A Beautiful Site, LLC. within 30 days of the
						subscription renewal to be eligible to receive an
						adjustment or credit at the discretion of the Company.
					</p>
					<p>
						Customers who are unsatisfied with the Service may
						request a refund no more than 30 days after their most
						recent renewal period. Upon requesting a refund, your
						account will be terminated and any refund deemed valid
						will be issued by the Company. Refunds will be issued
						no more than one business week after the request is
						made. To request a refund, <a href="contact.html">contact
						us via email</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept that
						A Beautiful Site, LLC. may exercise, at our discretion,
						service cancellation for delinquent accounts. You are
						responsible for ensuring the continuance of your account
						and compliance with this agreement.
					</p>

					<h2>Indemnity</h2>
					<p>
						You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold A Beautiful
						Site, LLC. harmless from and against any and all
						claims, liability, losses, costs, and expenses
						(including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with
						any use or alleged use of Surreal CMS.
