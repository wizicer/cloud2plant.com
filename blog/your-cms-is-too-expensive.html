						<p>The other day, someone wrote in to say, &#8220;your CMS is too expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked them what they thought a fair price would be, but that was all I&#8217;d ever hear from them. After pondering this for awhile, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that they either misunderstood our pricing model or they wanted our service to be completely free.</p>
<p>The reason I disagree with their statement is because, when you do the math, a few dollars a month isn&#8217;t much when you bundle it up with the cost of domain registrations and web hosting. Maybe they&#8217;re not presenting it to their clients right. Maybe they think something like 10 cents a day is&#8230;a lot?</p>
<p>I have another theory.</p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve talked to web designers and freelancers who let their clients maintain their own domains, hosting fees, etc. This is a bad idea. I know this because I&#8217;ve seen firsthand a number of clients unknowingly let their domains or web hosting expire. Sometimes they didn&#8217;t even know they were responsible for paying it. It&#8217;s hard to point fingers, even if you did inform them of the responsibility. It&#8217;s not their area of expertise—it&#8217;s yours.</p>
<p>My theory is that some people design-and-run. That is, they don&#8217;t build relationships with their clients. Instead, they get hired, do the job, get paid, and never interact with the client again. That&#8217;s really tragic, because building business relationships is critical to long-term success.</p>
<p>When you build relationships with your clients, not only will it open things up for additional business with them in the future, but they&#8217;ll consult with you and learn to trust your judgment as an expert in the field. They&#8217;ll listen to you and honor your recommendations. If you tell them to use a premium web host over a bulk host, they&#8217;ll agree. If you tell them to use a certain CMS to manage their content, they&#8217;ll oblige (this is especially true when the difference in costs are negligible). And if their experience with you is a good one, they&#8217;ll almost always tell their friends.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem here isn&#8217;t so much that our service is too expensive—we have many users that would argue otherwise. Maybe it&#8217;s that this particular person simply wasn&#8217;t into building relationships with his or her clients. Maybe they don&#8217;t want to be responsible for dealing with them after the job is done, in which case &#8220;free&#8221; would be a more attractive price for them.</p>
<p>I hope that&#8217;s not the case, but if it is, I hope that person realizes the cost of not building relationships with clients is much more than the couple dollars a month that we charge. It could cost them a lot of business in the long run.</p>
