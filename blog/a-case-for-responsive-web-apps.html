						<h2>The mobile revolution</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed all those people staring at their phones? In public, in the car, in line at the store? They never seem to take their eyes off their phone. What do you think they&#8217;re looking at?</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, the mobile revolution is here. You spend so much time, effort, and money trying to get visitors to your website, why not make their experience a pleasant one? (Hint: viewing a website shrunk down to 10% on a phone isn&#8217;t a pleasant experience.)</p>
<p>By now, you&#8217;ve likely heard of <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a>. If not, it essentially means that your website will &#8220;respond&#8221; to your visitors&#8217; screen size. Here&#8217;s an example of our app on a desktop and the same page on a phone:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-235 size-full" src="http://www.surrealcms.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/responsive-web-app.png" alt="" width="750" height="610" /></p>
<p>Through the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries">CSS media queries</a>, the website is built to adapt to virtually any screen size. This can drastically improve your visitors&#8217; experience—especially the ones glued to their phones.</p>
<p>This method has been applied to tons and tons of websites already. But what about web apps?</p>
<h2>Responsive web apps</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to load a web app on your phone when it was built for a desktop. To be frank, the experience just plain sucks. Some developers argue that building a separate mobile app is too time consuming, usually limited in functionality, or just plain silly.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t need to build a separate app anymore, and we have proof.</p>
<p>When we designed the latest version of our web app, we started from the ground up with the difficult requirement of making it fully responsive. Every page, every feature—everything. If it worked on a desktop, it should work equally as well on a tablet or phone. Whether the user could only click or tap, it shouldn&#8217;t prevent them from using the app and it shouldn&#8217;t make for a bad experience.</p>
<p>That turned out to be quite a challenge, but nothing we couldn&#8217;t overcome with a bit of perseverance. Granted, the world is still in that awkward <em>native app</em> vs. <em>web app</em> phase. Native apps are sexy. They&#8217;re faster. They&#8217;re better. Right?</p>
<p>Sure, but the HTML5 movement is pushing forward fast. There are <a href="http://phonegap.com/">apps</a> that let you develop in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and let you publish a native app—many offer access to device-specific APIs so you can access cameras, filesystems, etc. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> is a mobile platform that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its apps. Chrome browser extensions use the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted">same technologies</a>.</p>
<p>HTML isn&#8217;t going away—it&#8217;s just getting started.</p>
<p>That remark might make you think of when Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">pulled the plug</a> on HTML5 in favor of native apps, but that was two years ago. Things are getting better. Devices are getting faster. More JavaScript APIs are becoming available. Two years ago, we couldn&#8217;t have built the app we built today either.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about Facebook is that they had a functional app based on HTML5 that millions of people used. There were some gripes, but things worked pretty well otherwise. If they hadn&#8217;t jumped ship, things would have gotten significantly better.</p>
<h2>The native app dilemma</h2>
<p>Without turning this into a <em>native app</em> vs. <em>web app</em> argument, let&#8217;s look at a few important points that you&#8217;ll want to consider if you&#8217;re looking to build a native app.</p>
<p>Which platforms are you going to target? What devices will be supported? What languages will you need to know to develop your app for those platforms and devices? Does your company have developers with experience in all those languages?</p>
<p>As a bootstrapped company, this is why we chose to build a responsive web app. There was no way we could bring on developers for every device our users would want us to support. By building a web app, we were able to use technologies that we already understood. We were able to build a single version of the app that worked on any device, regardless of platform.</p>
<p>If we tried to build a native app, we&#8217;d most likely still be working on it. (And that would be just the first one!)</p>
<h2>Efficiency rules</h2>
<p>The resources we saved by building a responsive web app allowed us to accommodate desktops, tablets, and phones much faster than the native approach. We didn&#8217;t have to worry about hiring new people and bringing them up to speed. We didn&#8217;t have to buy and learn new hardware and software. We didn&#8217;t have to design a multitude of different apps (nor keep them all updated as new features get rolled out). It wasn&#8217;t exactly easy, but it was still easier and more efficient than the alternative.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we feel that we made a great decision to stick with a web app. We started with a responsive framework that was reliable and actively developed. We spent a lot of time tweaking and polishing the interface so it worked great on virtually any screen. We tested things thoroughly on a number of emulators and physical devices. The result was an app that &#8220;just works&#8221; on whatever browser you happen to be using. We were even able to use our app on a Nintendo Wii!</p>
<p>It may not be for everyone, but before you convince yourself that a native app is the only way to go, reconsider what you could achieve with a web app instead. You might be surprised at what you can do with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript these days.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re wondering how our responsive web app would compare to a native version? In all honesty, It may not be <em>quite</em> as good—but it would definitely give it a run for its money.</p>
